# Customer_Churn_Analysis

The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns and discover the key factors that influence customer retention. The analysis will be conducted using Python and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The focus will be on variables such as customer tenure, payment methods, contract types, monthly charges, and demographic attributes to determine which factors are most strongly associated with higher churn rates.
