## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for many businesses. This project explores churn patterns, identifies key factors, and builds predictive models to anticipate at-risk customers. The project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Results interpretation & actionable insights

## Features

- Clean and modular Python code
- Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step analysis
- Visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Machine learning models for churn prediction
- Clear documentation and comments

## Data

The dataset used is a sample of customer records with features such as:
- Demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Account information
- Customer behavior (usage, complaints, etc.)
- Churn status

*Note: Data file is included for demonstration purposes. Replace with your own data for production use.*

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asad-In-data/Customer_Churn_Analysis.git
cd Customer_Churn_Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the main Jupyter notebook:  
   `Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb`
2. Run the notebook cells step by step.
3. Review EDA, feature engineering, and model results.
4. Modify the code for your own dataset as needed.

## Results & Visualizations

- Key churn factors are visualized with charts and plots
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, etc.)
- Feature importance analysis
- Actionable recommendations
